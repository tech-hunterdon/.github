### Who
We are a growing community of technology enthusists who like to exchange ideas and hang out in local breweries.

### When
Unless otherwise noted, we meet on the 3rd Tuesday of the month on the second floor of [Lone Eagle Brewing](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/r/day?ctok=Y2xheUB0aG91Z2h0cmlnaHRzLmNvbQ&sf=true&pli=1).
